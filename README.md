# Skis

This is smd version of Bastl Skis v1. Main differences are:

* It has skis (two sliders) vs. no skis in Bastl version
* 6HP vs. 5HP, for obvious, OCD reasons
* Range switch vs. range backside jumper (although this switch works as a jumper - instead of going from freq0 to freq1, and then from freq1 to freq2 in the second position, it goes from freq0 to freq1, and then from freq0 to freq2; yeah, I might change this in the second version)
* Version 2 of Bastl Skis has decay CV input, and this one doesn't have it
* Version 1 of Bastl Skis was THT and had two sandwiched boards, and this one is SMT in one board.
